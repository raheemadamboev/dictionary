Simple Dictionary application that you can search for words and it gives you information about the word. UI is built by Jetpack Compose and Clean Architecture architectural pattern is applied. Information about word is requested from API by Retrofit and it is cached locally using Room database. Room database is single source of truth. Dependencies are injected using Dagger Hilt. Kotlin Coroutines are used for asynchronous work. Kotlin Flow is used to observe data.
